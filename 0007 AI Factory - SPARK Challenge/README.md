# AI SPARK Challenge
23-04-24 ~ 23-05-11<br><br>

AI Competition held by AI Facotry & SPACE-S.<br>
For details of the competition, AI Facotry & SPACE-S, please refer to this [webpage](https://aifactory.space/task/2317/overview).
<br><br>
This is my first time joining for a Data Science competition.<br>
For this challenge, we are permitted to use only the given dataset (TRAIN, TEST).<br>
There are 17 PM, 30 AWS data sets for each TRAIN and TEST, and matching geographic location data set.<br><br>

## Requirements
Here are the specific requirements for the competition.<br>
1. Predict hourly PM2.5 values for each region for a 3-day period using the PM2.5/AWS data of the past period (train set) and the PM2.5/AWS data for a 2-day period (test set).
2. The use of AWS values is mandatory for PM2.5 prediction. Any model that does not use AWS values will be invalidated.
3. Ensemble regulation (additional explanation)<br>
   Prediction must be performed using the same model for all observation stations, and ensemble methods such as averaging/weighted sum/voting of multiple models' inference results are not allowed.<br>
   However, if separate models are used for each target element during inference and the results are generated by inputting the inferred results into a separate model again (e.g., creating temperature and humidity prediction models and predicting PM2.5 using the predicted temperature and humidity), it is allowed as long as one model receives inputs from multiple stages to generate results.<br>In this case, however, the inference process must be connected through a seamless pipeline without any artificial intervention from the initial input to the final result generation.<br>
   The key is to prohibit ensemble models and aim to create a global model rather than creating separate models for each observation station (dedicated models that cannot be used outside the observation station).
1. The train set can be used for predicting the test set, but the test set cannot be used for model training.
