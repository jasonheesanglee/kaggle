# Sound Emotion Classification 
23-05-07 ~ 23-06-05<br>

AI Competition held by DACON.<br>
For details of the competition and DACON, please refer to their [webpage](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/236105/overview/description).

This is my second time joining for a Data Science competition.<br>
For this challenge, we are permitted to use only the given dataset (TRAIN, TEST).<br>

There are 5001 .wav format files, 1881 `.wav` format files for each TRAIN and TEST, and `.csv` files with 3 columns `id`, `path`, `label` for each TRAIN and TEST.<br><br>

`id` column contains the name of each `.wav` file.<br>
`path` column contains the path to each `.wav` file.<br>
`label` column contains the label of each `.wav` file â‡’ This label indicates which emotion each `.wav` file is showing.<br><br>

Here are the specific requirements for the competition.<br>

## Requirements
**Background**<br>
Hello everyone! Welcome to the monthly Deacon Speech Emotion Recognition AI Competition.<br>
Speech emotion recognition is a technology that identifies people's emotional states.<br>
Create an AI model that can judge people's emotions based on acoustic data!<br><br>

**Theme**<br>
Developing emotion recognition AI models based on acoustic data<br>

**Description**<br>
Create a model to recognize emotions from acoustic data!<br>

**Evaluation**<br>
Judging Criteria: Accuracy<br>
Primary Evaluation (Public Score): Scored on a randomly sampled 30% of the test data, publicly available during the competition.<br>
Secondary Evaluation (Private Score): Scored on the remaining 70% of the test data, released immediately after the competition ends<br>
The final ranking will be scored from the selected files, so participants must select the two files they would like to have scored in the submission window.<br>
The final ranking is based on the highest score of the two selected files.<br>
(If the final file is not selected, the first submitted file is automatically selected)<br>
The Private Score ranking released immediately after the competition is not the final ranking; the final winners will be determined after code verification.<br>
Determine the final ranking based on Private Score among submitting teams that have complied with the competition evaluation rules.<br><br>

**Notes**<br>
Maximum number of submissions per day: 3 times<br>
Available languages: Python, R<br>
Utilization of evaluation datasets in model training (Data Leakage) is not eligible for awards.<br>
All learning, inference processes, and inference outputs must be based on legitimate code, and submissions obtained by abnormal means will be considered a rule violation if detected.<br>
The final ranking will be scored from the selected files, so participants must select the files they want to be scored in the submission window.<br>
Private rankings released immediately after the competition are not final and winners will be determined after code verification.<br>
Dacon strictly prohibits fraudulent submissions, and if you have a history of fraudulent submissions to Dacon competitions, your evaluation will be restricted.<br><br>
